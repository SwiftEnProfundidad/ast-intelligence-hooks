This directory defines the declarative rule model for the enterprise core.
A rule is a structured statement of intent, not an implementation.
Rules describe what should be detected and how it should be classified.
They are evaluated by the rule engine, not by ad hoc logic.
Rule definitions are stable, explicit, and versionable.
They are composed into sets to express policy scope.
