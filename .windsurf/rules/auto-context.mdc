# 🤖 Autonomous Context Detection

This file is auto-generated by the Autonomous AST Intelligence System.

It will be regenerated dynamically based on:
- Staged files analysis
- Recent commit patterns  
- Branch context
- Platform confidence scoring

**Current status:** Template - awaiting first analysis

## How it works:

1. ContextDetectionEngine analyzes repo state
2. AutonomousOrchestrator scores confidence per platform
3. DynamicRulesLoader generates this file with relevant platform rules
4. Cursor AI applies rules automatically

## Confidence thresholds:

- ≥ 90%: Auto-execute ai-start (no confirmation)
- 70-89%: Ask AI for confirmation
- < 70%: Ignore (too ambiguous)
