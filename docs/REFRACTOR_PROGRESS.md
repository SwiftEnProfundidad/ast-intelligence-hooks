# Pumuki Refactor Progress (v2.x)

## Legend

- ✅ Done
- 🚧 In progress
- ⏳ Pending

## Phase 1 - Deterministic Core + Evidence v2.1

- ✅ Deterministic architecture is active: `Facts -> Rules -> Gate -> ai_evidence v2.1`.
- ✅ `ai_evidence` v2.1 schema (`snapshot + ledger`) is implemented as source of truth.
- ✅ Evidence serialization is stable and deterministic.
- ✅ Human intent preservation and expiry are supported.

## Phase 2 - Stage Policies + Shared Runners

- ✅ Stage policies are consolidated (`PRE_COMMIT`, `PRE_PUSH`, `CI`).
- ✅ Shared execution flow is centralized in `integrations/git/runPlatformGate.ts`.
- ✅ Runners are unified in `integrations/git/stageRunners.ts`.
- ✅ Gate output is normalized to `0/1`.

## Phase 3 - Multi-platform Gate (iOS, Backend, Frontend, Android)

- ✅ `PRE_COMMIT` is implemented for iOS, backend, frontend, and android.
- ✅ `PRE_PUSH` is implemented for iOS, backend, frontend, and android.
- ✅ `CI` is implemented for iOS, backend, frontend, and android.
- ✅ Combined platform detection is active (`integrations/platform/detectPlatforms.ts`).

## Phase 4 - Rule Packs + Skills Enforcement

- ✅ Baseline rule packs are available (ios, backend, frontend, android, heuristics).
- ✅ Rule pack versioning is defined (`core/rules/presets/rulePackVersions.ts`).
- ✅ Skills lock/policy compiler and validators are integrated in the gate flow.
- ✅ Stage-aware severity promotion for critical heuristics is implemented.

## Phase 5 - CI/Packaging Reliability

- ✅ CI workflows run gate stages and publish evidence artifacts.
- ✅ Package manifest guardrail is active.
- ✅ Package smoke (`block` + `minimal`) is green.
- ✅ Stage-gates command is simplified and deterministic.

## Phase 6 - CLI / Operational UX

- ✅ Interactive framework menu is implemented (`scripts/framework-menu.ts` + modules).
- ✅ One-shot Phase 5 closure orchestration is available (`validation:phase5-execution-closure`).
- ✅ Operational triage/support/unblock scripts are implemented.
- ✅ Mock consumer A/B report generation is implemented.

## Phase 7 - Documentation Governance

- ✅ Docs index coverage guardrail is active.
- ✅ Provider/IDE-agnostic guardrail is active.
- ✅ English-only guardrail is active.
- ✅ Markdown reference integrity guardrail is active.
- ✅ Root markdown baseline guardrail is active.
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` is normalized to the enterprise v2 baseline.

## Phase 8 - External Validation / Rollout Closure

- ✅ External rollout execution pack is published (`docs/validation/phase8-external-rollout-pack.md`).
- ✅ Local adapter runtime baseline was regenerated (`adapter-session-status`, `adapter-real-session-report`, `adapter-readiness`).
- ✅ Adapter hook runtime wiring was refreshed (`install:adapter-hooks-config`) and Node resolution is healthy (`node_bin=/opt/homebrew/bin/node`).
- ✅ Local hook simulation produces expected events (`pre_write` blocked + `post_write` logged) and `assess:any` passes.
- ✅ Adapter runtime validation reached green state (`adapter-session-status=PASS`, `adapter-readiness=READY`) after non-simulated runtime event capture.
- ✅ Phase 5 closure handoff artifacts were regenerated in mock-consumer mode with READY verdicts:
  - `.audit-reports/phase5/phase5-blockers-readiness.md`
  - `.audit-reports/phase5/phase5-execution-closure-status.md`
  - `.audit-reports/phase5/phase5-external-handoff.md`
- ✅ Private consumer startup-failure diagnostics were re-run with refreshed evidence (`.audit-reports/consumer-triage/*`), currently blocked by GitHub `404` on `SwiftEnProfundidad/pumuki-mock-consumer` Actions endpoints and missing `user` scope.
- ✅ `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s user` was attempted; GitHub device-flow interaction is required to finish scope elevation before live private-repo diagnostics can proceed.
- ✅ Startup-failure triage was rerun against an accessible private consumer (`SwiftEnProfundidad/pumuki-actions-healthcheck-temp`) and produced refreshed evidence (`.audit-reports/consumer-triage-temp/*`) plus external run URL evidence.
- ✅ Interactive `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s user` retry was executed in TTY mode; completion still requires manual device/browser confirmation.
- ✅ Controlled `workflow_dispatch` probe was executed on `pumuki-actions-healthcheck-temp`; latest evidence now captures one queued run without jobs plus one `startup_failure` run.
- ✅ Follow-up run inspection confirms the latest probe (`21878337799`) remains queued with empty job graph (`jobs=[]`), reinforcing external Actions-side blockage.
- ✅ External artifact URL evidence is attached in latest handoff (`.audit-reports/phase5/phase5-external-handoff-latest.md`).
- ✅ Latest Phase 5 blocker chain was recomputed with external evidence (`phase5-blockers-readiness-latest`, `phase5-execution-closure-status-latest`, `phase5-external-handoff-latest`) and is consistently `BLOCKED`.
- ✅ Escalation-ready evidence pack was consolidated with probes, triage outputs, and run URLs (`.audit-reports/phase5/consumer-escalation-pack-latest.md`).
- ✅ Support ticket draft attachments are now resolved dynamically from the active triage directory, and regenerated for `consumer-triage-temp`.
- ✅ Device-flow auth refresh was re-triggered and a fresh one-time GitHub code was generated for manual scope elevation (`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s user`).
- ✅ Auth-check contract now requires only `repo/workflow` scopes; billing probe is informational and no longer blocks startup-unblock.
- ✅ Consumer triage was rerun for `SwiftEnProfundidad/pumuki-actions-healthcheck-temp` with `auth-check=READY` and updated artifacts in `.audit-reports/consumer-triage-temp/*`.
- ✅ `phase5-blockers-readiness-latest` now resolves to `READY`; latest closure/handoff are blocked only by active `startup_failure` evidence.
- ✅ Additional live `workflow_dispatch` probe was executed (`21882829778`) and confirms the same external pattern (`queued` without jobs, no artifacts), with `startup_failure_runs` still present in latest support bundle.
- ✅ External escalation package and ticket were finalized (`#4077449`) with deterministic evidence bundle/checksums.
- ⏳ External Phase 5 final `READY` is deferred until billing reactivation on the consumer account.
- ✅ Real external pre/post tool hook runtime validation is green (`adapter-session-status=PASS`, `adapter-real-session-report=PASS`, `adapter-readiness=READY`).

- ✅ Docs-sync helper now also updates handoff `Expected:` checksum line, keeping `validation:phase5-escalation:ready-to-submit` green after refresh churn.
- ✅ Automated portal submission attempt was executed via browser automation; GitHub Support blocks at interactive web sign-in (`/session/login`) with no API/CLI bypass available.
- ✅ New clean browser session was opened and validated; support landing still requires fresh interactive auth in-session before ticket submission can continue.
- ✅ Root cause for external startup blockage is now confirmed as inactive/unavailable billing for GitHub Actions in the consumer account; retries are paused until billing is re-enabled.

- ⏳ Clear remaining queued/stalled startup blocker (`startup_stalled_runs > 0`) to move external handoff from `BLOCKED` to `READY` using fresh external escalation evidence.

## Remaining Task Queue (Explicit)

- ⏳ `P8-1` Unblock external consumer startup queue stall and reach `READY` chain (`consumer-startup-unblock-status` + `phase5-execution-closure-status`).
- ✅ `P8-2a` Execute pre-submission verification (bundle checksum + required evidence files) and record result in handoff.
- ✅ `P8-2b` Submit GitHub Support escalation using packaged evidence bundle and fill `Submission Tracking` fields in handoff (submitted: `4077449` by `SwiftEnProfundidad` at `2026-02-11T13:54:02Z`).
- ✅ `P8-2c` Automate `phase5-latest` docs sync from evidence signals/checksum (`scripts/sync-phase5-latest-docs.sh`, wired into refresh flow).
- ✅ `P8-3a` Publish deterministic post-billing resume runbook and index it in docs (`docs/validation/phase8-post-billing-reactivation-runbook.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/TODO.md`).
- ⏳ `P8-3` Waiting for billing reactivation in consumer account (known external dependency). Once reactivated, execute `validation:phase8:resume-after-billing` and validate `READY` chain.
- ⏳ `P8-4` Regenerate latest external handoff artifacts with `READY` verdict and close Phase 8 blocker (after billing reactivation + successful `P8-3`).
- ✅ `P7-1` Keep documentation hygiene maintenance active (root validation docs only; generated reports regenerated on demand).
- ⏳ `P8-5` Optional adapter external IDE replay evidence capture (deferred).
- ✅ TypeScript callback-style `fs.lutimes` heuristic is implemented end-to-end (`extractHeuristicFacts`, ruleset, stage promotion, tests).
- ✅ TypeScript callback-style `fs.fchown` heuristic is implemented end-to-end (`extractHeuristicFacts`, ruleset, stage promotion, tests).
- ✅ TypeScript callback-style `fs.fchmod` heuristic is implemented end-to-end (`extractHeuristicFacts`, ruleset, stage promotion, tests).
- 🚧 `P9-1` Execute next advanced AST semantic heuristic in local-only mode: callback-style `fs.fstat` detection (external billing path omitted).
- ⏳ `P10-1` Resume MCP/context API incremental expansion after Phase 8 closure.
