# Framework Work Tracking (TODO)

## Scope

This document tracks the agreed improvements for **Pumuki AST Intelligence Framework**.

## Done

- Refactor `README.md` to position the project as a framework (governance + lifecycle + commands).
- Add Git governance section documenting `ast:gitflow` and `ast:release` with options and flow.
- Add Developer Experience section (notifications + evidence freshness + git-tree guardrails).
- Make `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` more normative by adding invariants + control primitives.
- Add `human_intent` to `ai_evidence v2.1` and mirror it in `ai_gate` output.
- Enforce `human_intent.expires_at` (ignore stale intent deterministically).
- Add README section for manual hook-system usage (interactive + `AUDIT_OPTION` + command mapping).
- Convert root `ARCHITECTURE.md` into conceptual architecture linked to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Define canonical evidence writer path and deterministic merge strategy.
- Standardize visuals in `docs/images/` to consistent, resolution-independent assets.

## Next
