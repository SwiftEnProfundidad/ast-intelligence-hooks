# Enterprise Consumer Isolation Policy

This policy defines how Pumuki framework validation is executed during stabilization, to prevent accidental changes in enterprise consumer repositories.

## Scope

- Applies to all framework-maintenance work in this repository.
- Applies to all external consumer repositories used for diagnostics or rollout validation.

## Baseline Rule

During framework stabilization, enterprise consumer repositories are read-only validation targets.

- Do not commit, push, or open remediation branches in enterprise consumer repositories.
- Do not change workflows, source files, or configuration in enterprise consumer repositories as part of framework validation.
- Keep framework implementation and consumer application remediation as separate streams.

## Allowed Operations on Enterprise Consumers

- Read-only diagnostics:
  - CI artifact collection
  - startup triage report generation
  - workflow lint scans (report-only)
  - evidence capture for incident/support payloads
- Local temporary files generated by diagnostics are allowed only when ignored and cleaned after execution.

## Default Validation Target

Use a dedicated mock consumer repository for active integration validation:

- install Pumuki from local framework workspace
- run PRE_COMMIT / PRE_PUSH / CI runners
- execute deterministic A/B checks
- validate evidence generation (`.ai_evidence.json`, `version: "2.1"`)

## Exception Process

Enterprise consumer modifications require explicit operator approval and must be handled in the consumer repository lifecycle (separate change request), not in framework stabilization tasks.

## Enforcement Checklist

- [ ] Validation run starts in mock consumer repository first.
- [ ] Enterprise consumer diagnostics are read-only.
- [ ] No staged changes remain in enterprise consumer repository after diagnostics.
- [ ] Any required remediation is documented as external follow-up, not applied from framework tasks.
